# 🔍 Mine vs Rock Classification using Logistic Regression

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either **mines** or **rocks** based on frequency-based features.

The goal is to build a binary classification model and evaluate its performance using standard machine learning metrics.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Sonar signals are used to detect underwater objects. Each observation contains multiple frequency-based attributes extracted from the sonar return signal.

In this project, I:
- Prepared and explored the dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated classification performance

This is a **supervised binary classification problem**.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains:
- 208 observations
- 60 numeric frequency features
- 1 binary target label (Mine or Rock)

The dataset is included in this repository for reproducibility.
